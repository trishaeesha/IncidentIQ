# IncidentIQ

**Human-AI Decision Support for Evidence-Grounded Software Incident Troubleshooting**

IncidentIQ studies when evidence-grounded AI assistance improves or degrades human engineers' diagnostic decision-making during software incident investigation.

## Research question

> Under what software-incident conditions does evidence-grounded AI assistance improve or degrade human engineers' diagnostic decision-making?

## Core idea

IncidentIQ does not aim to autonomously resolve incidents. It structures incident evidence into observations, supporting evidence, contradictory evidence, missing information, candidate hypotheses, uncertainty, and suggested diagnostic next steps.

The research compares:

1. Human-only
2. Human + generic AI
3. Human + IncidentIQ

across controlled incident conditions such as clear, ambiguous, conflicting, incomplete, misleading, and novel evidence.

## Evaluation

Primary outcomes include final diagnosis accuracy, time to correct hypothesis, time to correct diagnostic action, unnecessary diagnostic actions, incorrect diagnostic actions, verification effort, AI reliance/override behavior, and confidence/calibration.

The central evaluation is not simply whether the AI gives the correct answer. It is whether the AI changes the engineer's decision process in a measurable and useful way.

## Data

The initial benchmark source is RCAEval (phamquiluan/RCAEval), which provides labeled software failure cases and multi-source telemetry for controlled incident scenarios.

Raw datasets are not committed to this repository. See data/README.md.

## Research discipline

This repository deliberately avoids claiming novelty for generic log anomaly detection, autonomous RCA, cost-aware tool selection, stopping policies, or abstention alone. Those areas already have substantial prior work.

The contribution must be demonstrated experimentally through human-AI diagnostic decision quality under different incident conditions.

## Status

**Implementation phase started.**

Current milestone: build the end-to-end IncidentIQ pipeline on a verified local subset of RCAEval, then scale the same pipeline to the benchmark.

The agreed research setup is fixed. Implementation work should not silently change the research question, six incident conditions, three comparison modes, or primary evaluation metrics.

## Development flow

1. Load verified RCAEval cases locally.
2. Extract structured incident evidence from metrics, logs, and traces.
3. Represent supporting, contradictory, and missing evidence.
4. Generate and compare candidate hypotheses.
5. Provide diagnostic guidance and uncertainty.
6. Expose the pipeline through the prototype UI/API.
7. Test on multiple cases.
8. Construct and validate the six incident conditions.
9. Run human-only, generic-AI, and IncidentIQ evaluations.
